With over 10 years of experience across academia and industry, my research focuses on using engineered nanoparticles as smart delivery systems to improve the performance of phytohormones and targeted amino acids in plants. By optimizing how these compounds are delivered and absorbed, I aim to strengthen plant resilience to both abiotic and biotic stresses and support more sustainable agricultural practices.

My work integrates nanotechnology with plant physiology to develop innovative strategies that enhance plant defense, crop quality, and horticultural productivity. These nanoparticle-enabled formulations have the potential to become a next generation of biostimulants, delivering higher efficiency while reducing chemical residues, helping advance cleaner, more sustainable crop management.
